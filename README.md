The client and server code appears to transfer files between each other. The client starts by asking for a password, and continues with the file transfer if the password entered matches "secret". The client opens a socket and connects to the server at IP address "127.0.0.1" and port 4456. It then sends the name of the folder to be transferred, and the files in the folder, one by one. The server opens a socket and listens on port 4456 for incoming connections. When a client connects, the server receives the folder name, creates a folder with that name in the "server_folder" directory, and receives the files from the client one by one, writing the received data to a file with the same name in the newly created folder. The transfer uses the UTF encoding format and transfers data in 1024-byte chunks. The client and server communicate through sending messages back and forth over the socket.
